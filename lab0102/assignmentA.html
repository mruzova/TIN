        <h1>What is <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum?</a></h1>
        <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the <em>printing and typesetting industry</em>.
            <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially<del>unchanged</del>. It was <small>popularised</small> in the 1960s with the release of <sub>Letraset
    
</sub> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        </p>
        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply <i>random</i>. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <mark>Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia</mark>,
            looked up one of the more obscure <ins>Latin</ins> words, <sup>consectetur</sup>, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from <b>sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</b>            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
            1.10.32.
