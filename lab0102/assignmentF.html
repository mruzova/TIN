                <h2>Why do cats purr?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-inner-life-of-cats/">Cats</a> purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is “please keep still and pay attention to me.” Kittens purr to persuade their mothers
                    to keep on nursing them, and pet cats purr when they want to be stroked. The vibrations emanating from the purr certainly have a calming effect on people. Yet sick cats will also purr as a cry for help. So purring doesn’t always mean
                    “I’m happy.” Some researchers have claimed that the vibrations from purring might help heal bone damage in an injured cat.</p>

                <h2>How do they purr?</h2>
                <p>The purr is an unusual <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-inner-life-of-cats/">vocalization</a>, made by rattling the vocal cords together rather than vibrating them by pushing air past them, which is how cats—and
                    humans—generate all their other vocal sounds. That’s why cats can purr when they’re breathing in and breathing out. Most species of wildcats can purr, including the cheetah. The exceptions are the big cats—lion, tiger, jaguar and leopard—whose
                    voice boxes are modified so that they can roar.</p>

                <h2>How can you get a cat to love you?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-inner-life-of-cats/">Cats</a> naturally feel affection for those who feed, look after and play with them, although they don’t always make that obvious. Trust can be harder to win
                    because some cats are just nervous. One trick is to always allow the cat to approach you rather than forcing yourself on the cat when you feel like it. When the cat does approach, reward it with a few treats and let it leave as soon
                    as it wants to. You should find that it comes to you a little sooner, and stays for a little longer, each time.
